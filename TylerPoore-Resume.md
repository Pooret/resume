## Summary:
I am a data scientist specializing in NLP and chemistry. I left my PhD at Columbia to co-found two companies in the biotech and biomedical spaces, collaborating with Columbia to develop novel IP based on my work. My background in data mining and computational chemistry has provided me with concrete experience in cleaning and parsing raw text data, as well as building and applying transformer-based models to identify chemical entities in text. Currently, I consult for several companies, working on projects that involve extracting financial information from scraped data and identifying users most likely to sign up for a newsletter. I am also working on a personal project aimed at predicting the chemical properties of drug targets. 

## Skills:
- Programming Languages: Python, SQL
- Data Analysis and Visualization Tools: Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Statsmodels, Seaborn
- Machine Learning Libraries: scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch
- Big Data Technologies: PySpark, MongoDB, Google BigQuery, Databricks
- Natural Language Processing: NLTK, gensim, Stanza, SpaCy, NLP Pipelines, Regex, HuggingFace, OpenAI
- Domain Knowledge: Github, JIRA/Sprint Planning, Organic Chemistry, Linear Algebra/Backprop Calculus, Biomedical Engineering, Startup Strategy, Shareholder/Stakeholder Engagement, Healthcare, Chemical Synthesis, Intellectual Property

## Experience:
**Consultant**
- **Port** (Nov. 2022 - Current): Created a BERT-based model to identify honorifics in text data with 94% accuracy, allowing Port to extract personal identifiers from an information pipeline. Currently analyzing text and financial data to create a model for credit union failure prediction.
- **Brandroll** (Mar. '23 - Current): Currently developing an application that determines users that are most likely sign up for a company newsletter and sends it out at regular intervals.

**IrOs, LLC.** (Mar. 2015 - Nov. 2019)
- Co-Founder, New York, NY: Led end-user engagement, product development, and operational planning

**ExSponge, Inc.** (Nov. 2013 - Jan. 2015)
- CTO, New York, NY: Developed biomimetic polymer synthesis method, co-authored patents, and created pitch decks for fundraising

## Projects:
- [Predicting Company Stock Movements from CEO Tweets](https://github.com/Pooret/Predicting-Executive-Stock-Movements): Scraped tweets using Twint from high-profile CEOS and developed a model to predict their company stock movements based off tweets
- [Wine Quality Classification through Decision Boundary Analysis](https://github.com/Pooret/Wine-Quality-Classification): Engineered a stacking classification pipeline for wine quality prediction for red and white wines

## Education:
**Springboard** (Jan. 2021 - Jan. 2022)
- Data Scientist Fellow, New York: Completed Data Science Career Track with Advanced Machine Learning specialization. Roughly equivalent to a Masters in DS. Built and developed tools for analyzing and cleaning text data, developed end-to-end ML projects using Flask and Django and DataBricks. Developed SQL Queries for extracting data from large datasets.

**Columbia University** (2010 - 2013)
- MA in Organic Chemistry, 2010-2013: Worked on catalytic ring closures of alkaloids, [published in a high-impact journal](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/236267070_An_Efficient_Approach_to_the_Securinega_Alkaloids_Empowered_by_Cooperative_N-Heterocyclic_CarbeneLewis_Acid_Catalysis)

**Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI)** (2005 - 2010)
- BS/MS in Chemistry, 2005-2010: Summa Cum Laude, Founder's Award of Excellence
